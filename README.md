# DataCo Supply Chain Analysis using Power BI

## Executive Summary
This project aims to develop interactive dashboards using Power BI for DataCo Organization, focusing on transaction types, delivery performance, customer segmentation, and product profitability. The primary goal is to provide business insights through visual representation, enhancing data-driven decision-making across sales, logistics, and customer service.

---

## Problem Statement
### Background
Restricted access to real-time delivery metrics and transactional data obstructs the decision-making process, complicating efforts to anticipate delays, optimize inventory, and achieve customer satisfaction goals. This ultimately affects logistics efficiency and service quality.

### Objective
Develop an integrated analytics solution for real-time monitoring of KPIs in sales, focusing on:
- Sales performance
- Delivery efficiency
- Customer insights
- Product management

### Scope
This project encompasses:
- Transaction analysis for sales performance
- Customer analysis for trends
- Shipping and delivery metrics for efficiency
- Product management to optimize inventory and marketing strategies

---

## Data Sources
The primary data source will be the dataset collected from Kaggle and the DataCo organization. It includes:
- Transaction type
- Shipment details
- Order details
- Product benefits
- Mode of shipment
- Discounts given
- Profit ratios
- Other related details

---

## Methodology
### Data Integration
Power BI's data integration capabilities will be leveraged to integrate various data sources, including geographic and sales information, as well as additional contextual data. This approach will enhance the analysis and provide a holistic perspective on supply chain data.

### Dashboard Design
- Organize dashboard elements (charts, tables, and metrics) based on importance, using larger visuals for key metrics and smaller visuals for supporting data.
- Use a variety of visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, maps, stacked bar charts) to represent different data aspects effectively, simplifying complex data for better understanding.

### Interactivity
- Dashboards will feature a high level of interactivity, enabling users to navigate the data using filters, slicers, and drill-down options.
- Users will have the ability to segment the data dynamically, including locations, facilitating deeper insights and analysis.

---

## Expected Outcomes
1. Interactive dashboards providing real-time insights into supply chain data such as delivery performance, profits, and sales.
2. Actionable insights enabling data-driven decisions, such as delivery performance optimization.
3. Users will be able to explore data from multiple perspectives, segmenting by factors such as customer segment, region, location, and time, to perform tailored analyses meeting specific business needs.
4. By monitoring delivery performance and sales trends in real-time, the organization will be better equipped to predict delays and implement corrective actions to improve logistics and customer satisfaction.

## Risks and Challenges
1. **Data Quality:** Incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent data from internal sources (e.g., missing order zip codes or incorrect product status) can lead to unreliable analysis and poor decision-making.
2. **Scalability Issues:** As the dataset grows with additional transactions, products, and regions, maintaining the system's performance and ensuring the dashboards remain responsive can become a challenge.

---

## Conclusion
The Supply Chain project leverages Power BIâ€™s advanced features to deliver key insights, helping anticipate delivery delays and improving operational efficiency. By integrating and analyzing critical data, the project aims to enhance data-driven decision-making, uncover growth opportunities, and contribute to the overall success and expansion of the business.
